## Why HTML/CSS

I don't always write my apps 'the old way' üòÅ. Normally, I'd go for a React app, using Typescript and for a back end I'd probably opt for a GraphQL set up.

However, for such a small, personal project, I was curious to see how far I'd get going back to basics.

The repos on this profile are a bit older, but I have been coding a lot profesionally. If you'd like to know a bit more about my technical skills, feel free to get in touch!
